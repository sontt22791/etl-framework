# Mass Street Analytics ETL Framework

This is a framework for moving data into a data warehouse. It includes everything you need to set up a self-service data platform.

This is the system that is used when Mass Street resources are tasked with implementing data warehouses. The framework has been in development since 2011. It is currently powering the analytics for several small to medium sized firms with anywhere from a few hundred GBs to several TBs of historical data.

There should be ZERO references to any specific system or database aside from Reporting and ODS. If you should find such a reference, please log an issue.
